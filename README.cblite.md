# The `cblite` Tool

`cblite` is a command-line tool for inspecting and querying [LiteCore][LITECORE] and [Couchbase Lite][CBL] databases (which are directories with a `.cblite2` extension.)

For build instructions, see [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). For convenience, binaries are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-mobile-tools/releases) tab.

> NOTE: The _source code_ for the tools is Apache-licensed, as specified in [LICENSE](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-mobile-tools/blob/master/LICENSE). However, the pre-built [cblite](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-mobile-tools/blob/master/README.cblite.md) binaries are linked with the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase Lite, so the usage _of those pre-built binaries_ will be guided by the terms and conditions specified in Couchbase's [Enterprise License](https://www.couchbase.com/ESLA01162020).

Official support of the `cblite` tool is not yet available. This applies also to the pre-built binaries that are linked with the Enterprise Edition of Couchbase.

## Changes

(For details on flags and subcommands, use the `help` command.)

#### June 2020:

* The Enterprise-Edition build can now open encrypted databases. Interactive mode will automatically prompt for a password; in one-shot mode you must add the `--encrypted` flag before the database name to get the prompt. A raw AES256 key can be entered at the password prompt as a 64-digit hex string.
* Improvements to the `file` subcommand:
  * Renamed to the more memorable `info`. But `file` still works.
  * Now displays more information, like the total on-disk size of document bodies and metadata.
  * `--verbose` flag makes it show even _more_ information.
  * New sub-subcommand `info indexes` lists the database indexes.
* The `cp` (AKA `push`, `pull`) subcommand now supports replication over TLS.
* The `revs` subcommand now shows closed conflict branches.
* Terminal output uses ANSI colors by default if the semi-standard `CLICOLOR` environment variable is set.
